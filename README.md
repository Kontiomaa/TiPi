# TiPi

Order system for vehicle transport companies

Basically the site's functionality is divided in to two sides: The admins' and the users'.

After logging in the users can make new transportation orders for their cars, view their profile, change their password and also view their already made orders.

The admin can check his/her profile and change the password. Register new users and the companies they represent. Manage said users and companies. Manage received orders to certain states (New, accepted, completed etc..)
